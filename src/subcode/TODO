This folder contains subroutines/helper functions for the main Matlab
GUI interface AgBotGUI.m

Create README giving quick overview of each Matlab function.

Explain: To retain memory of where the Agbed Head currently is in
case of Power Loss, Emergency shutoff, etc., a file was created for
redundancy (not really redundancy as the MSP432 does not have 
non-volatile memory). When the System is rebooted, if the file is
non-void, the saved location will be imported into AgBed's Head 
current location, thus saving the need to recalibration and
preventing run-time errors of going outside of the valid range.
